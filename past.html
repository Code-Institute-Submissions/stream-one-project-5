					<h3>Saturday 14 October 2017</h3>
					<p>Parking by the old pump house on the road between Princetown and Merrivale, we headed through some very boggy ground before climbing up to the top of Great Mis Tor. We then turned west and headed down to the River Walkham, crossing over carefully where the Grimstone and Sortridge Leat branches away from the river. Following the leat below the Staple Tors, we crossed the main road by Merrivale Quarry and then picked up the stone row, before following the road back to the cars.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 9 September 2017</h3>
					<p>Having parked near the Bronze Age settlement of Grimspound, we headed up Hameldown Town and then followed the Two Moors Way in the direction of Widecombe-in-the-Moor and its impressive church. We dropped down into Widecombe for lunch, before following the road north towards Natsworthy Manor. Just past Natsworthy we branched off to the left to head uphill again, we were able to enjoy another close look at the stone hut circles of Grimspound before returning to the cars.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 12 August 2017</h3>
					<p>Starting out at Meldon Reservoir, this walk took us to the highest point in Devon. The day began with a very steep climb on the way to Black Tor, where we took a brief rest before heading even higher to Yes Tor and High Wilhays, the very top of Dartmoor. We followed a military road towards West Mill Tor on the way down and then with the weather beginning to deteriorate, made our way across Red-a-Ven Brook and headed back across Meldon Dam to the cars as quickly as we could.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 8 July 2017</h3>
					<p>On a very warm day, we parked the cars near to Thornworthy and headed past Middle Tor and Kestor Rock towards the North Teign River and Teign-e-ver clapper bridge. Having crossed the bridge, we paused by the famous Tolmen Stone and the impressive Scorhill Stone Circle, before picking up the road towards Gidleigh. We then turned south to head through the woods and back across the river, before joining up with the Two Moors Way and following it back to the cars.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 10 June 2017</h3>
					<p>This walk was timed perfectly to see the bluebells out in force. Parking near to Saddle Tor, we set off in the direction of Haytor Rocks before joining up with the disused tramway. Passing by Smallacombe Rocks, we dropped down into the woods to cross Becka Brook before tackling the steep climb up the other side. After stopping for lunch by the medieval village of Hundatora, we passed through thousands of bluebells on Holwell Lawn before following the road back to Saddle Tor.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 13 May 2017</h3>
					<p>Starting out at Steps Bridge on the River Teign, we headed through Bridford Wood and past Heltor Rock before following the road through Westcott. After carefully crossing the main road we climbed steeply uphill and headed west to Mardon Down, before following another road back downhill and into Cod Wood. After crossing the river by the road bridge, we walked back along the north bank and through a field of wild daffodils to bring us back to the cars.</p>
