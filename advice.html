		<h2>Walking Advice</h2>
		<p>Although none of our routes are too strenous or hazardous, it is always important when heading out for a day's walking to be properly prepared. All group members are responsible for ensuring that they have the correct clothing and any equipment that they may need. Group organisers reserve the right to refuse participation to anyone who is not suitably prepared for a walk. The information below provides a basic guide to what you may need, while further information is readily available across the internet.</p>

			<h3>Clothing</h3>
			<p>It is a good idea to wear multiple layers when going out hiking, as that enables you to adapt more easily to changing weather conditions. Ideally, there should be a lightweight layer first, preferably made from a quick-drying fabric rather than cotton which can remain wet and leave you at risk of feeling cold. Over that can be a fleece or some kind of insulated jacket to keep in the warmth, with a breathable outer layer, which will allow sweat to escape but should ideally be waterproof. Trousers should also be quick-drying, and jeans should certainly be avoided as they can become very heavy if they get wet.</p>

			<h3>Footwear</h3>
			<p>It is vital to have suitable footwear for walking as blisters or a twisted ankle can very easily ruin a day out. You should have a well-fitted shoe or boot which is not too tight, especially around the toes as blisters will otherwise develop quickly. It is important that the tread on the sole is deep enough to be secure on paths which may be slippery. Boots will offer more protection to the ankles than shoes, while if you want your footwear to be waterproof you may have to choose leather over fabric or apply waterproofing yourself. Fabric is lighter and may prove more comfortable, especially on shorter walks.</p>

			<h3>Equipment</h3>
			<p>You will need a rucksack to carry your equipment in, but if you are only going out for day-long walks this need not be too big. A 33-litre pack might well be sufficient, enabling you to carry food, water and some additional clothing. Many people find walking poles a great help, especially on moorland walks, as they can take a considerable amount of pressure off your knees and also provide help with balance when encountering particularly difficult terrain. It is essential for someone in the group to carry a detailed map - do not rely on smartphone apps such as Google Maps, but make sure you have a phone in case of emergencies.</p>

			<h3>Preparation</h3>
			<p>It is a good idea to have as good a grasp of your route as possible before you set out, especially if you are walking alone or leading others. If you have a map with a weather-proof coating, such as the Ordnance Survey 'Active' maps, you can mark out your route with a washable marker and then wipe it away once you have completed the walk. Try to pick out some obvious points of reference which may help you out should you be unsure of your exact location. It may be worth ensuring someone in the group knows how to read a compass. Finally, consider telling someone else roughly what time you intend to set off and arrive.</p>
