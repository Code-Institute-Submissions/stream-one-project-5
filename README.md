# Code Institute Stream One Project
 
This is a project website for Code Institute Full Stack Development course Stream One. It is a sample website for a walking group based in the south-west of England, a small group which organises monthly walks in Devon and Cornwall both on moorland and along the coast path. 

The website provides information for both existing and potential group members, covering future events and past walks as well as information about the hobby of walking itself.
