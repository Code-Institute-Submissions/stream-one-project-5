				<h3>Saturday 11 November 2017<br />10.00 am</h3>
				<p>Meet in the car park at the top of the hill just east of Dousland. We will walk up the route of the old Yelverton to Princetown railway, crossing the new Peekhill Bridge. We will stay on the old railway line until shortly after Ingra Tor, before turning east and then south-east past some hut circles to cross the main B3212 road. We will soon reach Black Tor and its impressive Logan Stone.</p>
				<p>Dropping downhill towards the River Meavy, we will pick up the Devonport Leat at the point where an aqueduct carries it across the river. We will then follow the leat through the woods above Burrator Reservoir. Picking up the road for a short stretch below Leather Tor, we branch away briefly through the woods again and end with a short uphill climb via the road back to the car park. The route is relatively easy, although there is one steep downhill section.</p>
