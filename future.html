					<h3>Saturday 11 November 2017</h3>
					<p>We will start out from the car park at the top of the hill just east of Dousland. We will walk up the route of the old Yelverton to Princetown railway, crossing the new Peekhill Bridge. We will stay on the old railway line until shortly after Ingra Tor, before turning east and then south-east past some hut circles to cross the main B3212 road. We will soon reach Black Tor and its impressive Logan Stone.</p>
					<p>Dropping downhill towards the River Meavy, we will pick up the Devonport Leat at the point where an aqueduct carries it across the river. We will then follow the leat through the woods above Burrator Reservoir. Picking up the road for a short stretch below Leather Tor, we branch away briefly through the woods again and end with a short uphill climb via the road back to the car park. The route is relatively easy, although there is one steep downhill section.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 9 December 2017</h3>
					<p>We will set out from the China Clay quarries near Lee Moor, heading east along the top edge of the quarry and past some stone circles. Turning north, we will climb past the cairns of Shell Top with a spectacular view back towards Plymouth Sound, before heading on to the trig point at the top of the hill. From there, we will turn north-west and head across to Hentor Warren and more evidence of stone circles.</p>
					<p>Heading downhill again, we will reach the River Plym and look down on Ditsworthy Warren House, used in the film 'War Horse', from where we will turn west and follow the leat which runs above the river. We will stay alongside the leat until we reach Trowlesworthy Warren, then turn south and head through yet more ancient settlements. After crossing two separate branches of a stream, we will have a short uphill climb back to the car park.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 13 January 2018</h3>
					<p>A slightly shorter route in case the weather is poor, we start out from the car park at Norsworthy Bridge at the eastern end of Burrator Reservoir. We will head east up towards Down Tor, then on to the impressive stone circle and stone row. Continuing east past an old tinner's hut, a good spot for lunch, we will eventually come to Nun's Cross and turn northwards.</p>
					<p>After following a track north for a short time, we will come to a branch of the Devonport Leat and turn westwards, following the leat until we come to Crazy Well Pool. From there we will turn south-west and join up with Raddick Hill. Passing the edge of the plantations to the north of Burrator, that track will bring us back down to the car park. Although the route is shorter, it should be noted that the initial climb up to Down Tor is quite steep in places.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 10 February 2018</h3>
					<p>We will be heading down to Bodmin Moor for a walk which will start in the village of Minions. Passing the Mining Heritage Centre, we will head north from the village towards the distinctively shaped 'Cheesewring', standing high above an abandoned quarry. After passing over the top of the hill, we will descend towards a farm and then head upwards again towards Sharp Tor and then continue north to Kilmar Tor.</p>
					<p>From Kilmar Tor, we turn south-west onto the route of a dismantled railway and follow it around the western side of Langstone Downs, eventually coming back towards the same farm that we encountered earlier. This time we will pass to the west of the farm and walk along below the Cheesewring, giving a very different view from earlier in the route. We will continue south towards the impressive stone circles of 'The Hurlers', which lie just before the car park.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 10 March 2018</h3>
					<p>A coastal walk on the Rame Peninsula in Cornwall which will be done in two loops, allowing for easy half-day participation. Parking at Cawsand in the morning, we will follow the coast path south-east to Penlee Point, then westards to Rame Head with its medieval chapel. Heading north to Polhawn Fort, we will climb steeply away from the coast path to the road, which we will follow for a short distance as we drop back down to Cawsand for lunch.</p>
					<p>In the afternoon we head north-east from Cawsand towards Picklecombe Fort and Mount Edgcumbe Country Park, where there will be the opportunity to stop for a while. We will then climb up through the Deer Park towards the impressive Maker Church, before heading south-west parallel to the main road. Finally, we will pick up a footpath which drops us back down to sea level, passing through Kingsand on the way back to Cawsand. It should be noted that this route is strenuous in places, especially if both loops are to be completed.</p>

					<h3>Saturday 14 April 2018</h3>
					<p>Parking down a short track off the A386 near Lydford, we will east towards the River Lyd then branch north to Nodden Gate. Following the old tramway north-east, we will pass Great Nodden and then turn sharply south-east at the point where the trams used to turn. We will stay on this route until we are level with the spectacular Great Links Tor, where we will branch off to head up to the top of the tor.</p>
					<p>From Great Links Tor, we head east past Dunna Goat to the ruins of Bleak House, possibly crossing Rattle Brook to explore, before heading south-west to Chat Tor. From there, we will head due west downhill to cross Doetor Brook, before heading on to Brat Tor and the distinctive site of Widgery Cross on top of the rocks. From Brat Tor, we will head steeply downhill and cross the River Lyd by the stepping stones on the way back to the car park.</p>
